## BBM 301 - Programming Languages Week 1: Exam Cheatsheet

**Why Study Programming Languages?**

* Become a more well-rounded computer scientist, not limited to one or two languages.
* Understand fundamental concepts behind language design, leading to better programming skills.
* Make informed choices about which language is best suited for different tasks.

**Key Concepts**

* **Programming languages are constantly evolving!**  Be ready to learn new ones.
* **Languages shape how we think about programming.**  Explore different paradigms.
* **Trade-offs are inevitable.** No single language is perfect for everything.

**Evaluation Criteria**

* **Readability:** Easy to read and understand.  Look for simplicity, orthogonality, clear syntax.
* **Writability:** Easy to write programs in. Factors include simplicity, abstraction, and expressiveness.
* **Reliability:** Performs as expected under all conditions. Type checking, exception handling, limited aliasing. 
* **Cost:** Considers training, development, compilation, execution, maintenance, and reliability costs.

**Language Categories**

* **Imperative:** Variables, assignments, and iteration (e.g., C, Java, Python).
* **Functional:** Computation through functions (e.g., LISP, Scheme).
* **Logic:** Rule-based (e.g., Prolog).
* **Markup/Programming Hybrid:** Markup + programming (e.g., JSTL).

**Implementation Methods**

* **Compilation:**  Direct to machine code (faster execution).
* **Interpretation:** Line-by-line execution (more flexible).
* **Hybrid:**  Combines both approaches.

**Remember:** This cheatsheet is just a reminder of key points. Refer to the detailed summary for a thorough understanding before your exam.  Good luck!
