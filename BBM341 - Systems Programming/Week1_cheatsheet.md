## BBM341 Systems Programming Week 1:  Exam Cheatsheet

**Core Theme:** Bridge the gap between abstraction and reality in programming for greater effectiveness.

**Five Realities:**

1. **Limited Precision:** Ints and floats aren't perfect representations of integers and real numbers. Beware of overflow and round-off errors!
2. **Assembly Matters:** Understand assembly for debugging, performance tuning, and system software.
3. **Memory is Key:** 
    * It's finite - manage it carefully.
    * Bugs are hard to find - be vigilant.
    * Performance isn't uniform - optimize access patterns.
4. **Performance Beyond Big O:** Constant factors & code structure matter. Measure, analyze, and optimize at multiple levels.
5. **Computers are More Than CPUs:** I/O and network interactions are crucial; concurrency, reliability, and compatibility become vital.

**Course Focus:**

* Become a more effective programmer through a deep understanding of systems.
* Write better programs by leveraging OS features (concurrency, signals).
* Unleash your inner "hacker" - in a good way! 

**Key Topics:**

* Low-level programming (bits, assembly)
* Memory hierarchy (caches, virtual memory)
* Performance optimization
* Exceptional control flow
* Virtual memory management

**Remember:** This is a high-level overview. Review the detailed summary for comprehensive knowledge before the exam. Good luck!
